# Leetcode
codes for playing with leetcode

##### Some Tips
some special scripts to make playing with leetcode much more easier

- [`easyProgram.py`]: a script helps build class and input automatically
- [`Tree.py`]: a script contains BinaryTree class where you can import and generate a binary tree and then play with it
- [`LinkedList`]: as `Tree.py`
- [`DecoratorHelper.py`]: contains tools to measure runtime and draw the tree(also in tree module)
- [`try.py`]: just for fun


### Disclaimer
- Not all codes are mine though I wrote most of them
- Some codes are copied from `discuss forum` on `leetcode`
	- I learned a lot from these codes by testing them locally
	- Thanks to them
